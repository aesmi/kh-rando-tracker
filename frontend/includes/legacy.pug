h1 This version is deprecated and #[i will be replaced]
p Please use the #[a(href="next") 2.0 version] of this tracker. 2.0 has been available for a while as a 'preview', but is now going to completely replace this version and become standard.
p #[b Because 2.0 was a complete rewrite with completely different internal design, settings will not carry over, however there is a button under Settings to migrate all your settings over from this version with a single click.]
p The 2.0 version by default will be on Important Checks Mode. I suggest reading through the Info > Help > Important Checks Mode tab to learn how it works. If you don't want to use this mode, there is still a 'normal' mode similar to how this version works, which you can use by disabling the 'Important Check Mode' toggle near the bottom.
p Aside from the important checks mode, 2.0 currently also offers more customisation options, MUCH easier layout/icon order customisation, cross-session autosave, and other minor changes. There is also a desktop application version, however for now not much focus has been put into it.
p 2.0 will be the only version receiving updates from this point onwards. This verson stopped receiving updates 4 months ago. Most of my work has been and will continue to be in the important checks mode, since this type is becoming the standard.
p On March 1 (or earlier), this page will be replaced with the 2.0 version, and 1.5 will be moved to a different page. If there is any reason why you can't or don't want to switch, please contact me regarding it. I believe I've done enough for there to be no reason not to be able to switch, but if there's anything holding you back, or anything that's an inconvienence, you can find me in the #[a(href="https://discord.gg/EB4WY5V") Rando Discord], with nickname 'zax' and username michael_#6969, or #[a(href="https://twitter.com/z_ax__") Twitter (@Z_ax__)]. My DMs are open on discord specifically to people #[b #[u in the Rando Discord]], and my Twitter DMs are open to everyone. There is also a #[a(href="https://github.com/zaxutic/kh2fm-rando-tracker") GitHub repository] if you wish to report issues there.
